            <p>Based in New Jersey, Cosmic Cry encapsulates the creative output of self taught trans creative, Ashley Maximillian, who embraces an absurdist DIY attitude whose output consists of, and often combines, elements of digital and analogue visuals and sound. A through line of wild chaos magic and fearlessly pushing boundaries brings it all together, representing Ashley’s desire to channel her drive for exploration and transformation.
            </p>
                <p>
                Ashley has been active as an artist since 2014 when one of her original songs was included on “Just Sign on the Dotted Line”, a compilation from Electro-Faustus, alongside legendary Japanese noise artist, Merzbow. After that, she contributed art and a few tracks to Uninvited Records. She is familiar with performance and pop up galleries, having collaborated with  artist EKG and sound designer Jefferson Wells as The Avant Squad (TAS) from 2015-2017. Together, they transformed gallery spaces such as the Tender Trap in Greenpoint, Brooklyn and Works on Paper in Philadelphia into black voids of iconography, symbols, and noise. During that time, Ashley took part in a tour for Andrew Shirley’s  film, “Wastedland 2,” playing shows up and down the East Coast. Since then, Ashley has worked toward building an online and in person community by performing and vending at local art events. She started mixing and mastering music in 2022, mostly working with antifascist black metal and punk bands.
                In 2023, one of her paintings was published in Variant Lit.

                    More recently, she began diving into a passion she had explored on and off over the years: programming. Ashley got her first taste of coding when she took an Intro to Java class in high school. Later explorations included customizing a weapon pack for DOOM II and learning about Processing, a programming language created specifically for artistic expression

                        She is driven by her love for all shades of teal and will always order the burger on the menu.
